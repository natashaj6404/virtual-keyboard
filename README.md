This is a virtual keyboard that works by tracking your hand movement :)
1) run "pip install mediapipe" if you do not have it
2) you will need openCV installed aswell.
3) run the python file in vscode and wait a few seconds for your camera to start up
4) a camera screen alongside a keyboard will open
5) to "click" a letter, you must hover over it for approx 1 second by using 2 fingers
6) the letter chosen will show up in the box above
7) to exit the screen, click escape
